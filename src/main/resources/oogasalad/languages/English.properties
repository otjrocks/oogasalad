# Help Guide Messages
WELCOME_TITLE=Welcome to the Game Authoring Environment
WELCOME_CONTENT=This help guide will walk you through the main features of the authoring environment and how to create your own games.
OVERVIEW_TITLE=Overview
OVERVIEW_CONTENT=The Game Authoring Environment allows you to create 2D pacman variations without writing code. Key features include:\n\n-Entity based game design\n-Mode based entity management\n-Visual level editor\n-Collision rule system\n-Configurable win and lose conditions
INTERFACE_CONTENT=The authoring environment consists of these main areas:\n\n	\n-Menu (slides 4-5): The top bar; file management for saving and loading\n	\n-Entity Settings (slides 6-7): The right panel as well as the center tile editor; creating entities and their modes and using the tile editor to modify their placements on a level\n	\n-Level Settings (slides 8-9): The left panel; changing level settings and mode and spawn events\n	\n-Game Settings (slides 10-11): The bottom window; edit metadata, win conditions, starting score, and speed, cheat codes, collision rules
INTERFACE_TITLE=Main Interface
SAVE_TITLE=Menu: Save
SAVE_CONTENT=Save, choose a folder, the Authoring Environment will save the game into a folder named output within the chosen location.\n\n- If the location already has an output folder, it will add onto the output the new information / rewrite files with the same name.\n- This saved output is ready to upload in the Game Player to play.\n\nYou can either save the folder and stay in the authoring environment by using the save in the file, or exit and save.
UPLOAD_TITLE=Menu: Upload
UPLOAD_CONTENT=You can also upload in an existing game, go inside the folder structure and upload the gameConfig.json associated with the game.
ENTITY_TITLE=Entity Types and Modes
ENTITY_CONTENT=The main game design revolves around entities and their modes, within this panel you can create and edit entities and modes. You can configure things such as how the mode behaves including how they are controlled/their AI, their speed, and their look.\n\nThis also allows you to delete entity modes as well as types and update the environment accordingly
PLACEMENT_TITLE=Entity Placement and Level Editor
PLACEMENT_CONTENT=Then to begin creating your level using these entities, you can drag the icon for the entity onto the tile based level editor.\n\n- Misplaced it? can drag on the level editor to move it.\n- Don't want it anymore? Click on the placement you want to change and you can delete it.\n- Want it to start off in a different mode? Click on the placement you want to change and you can edit it.
LEVEL_TITLE=Level Settings
LEVEL_CONTENT=Can edit each levels width, height and background images. From here you can also select which level you want to update and that will update the tile level map viewer.
EVENTS_TITLE=Level Events
EVENTS_CONTENT=- For each level you can configure different events that only happen on that level.\n\n- You can configure to spawn at certain times or at certain score thresholds or despawn under these conditions (or not despawn)\n\n- Can also set entities that already exist that are in one mode to change to a different mode after a set amount of time.
SETTINGS_TITLE=Game Settings
SETTINGS_CONTENT=- Can update the games metadata such as its title, the author and a description.\n\n- Can update game settings such as how fast it is, how many lives and score you start off with and the win and loss conditions\n\n- Additionally, you can decide if you want to add some cheat codes to your game such as adding lives, going to the next level, speeding up the game speed, etc.
COLLISION_TITLE=Collision Rules
COLLISION_CONTENT=- Last but not least is collision rules.\n\n- This governs how your entities interact with each other. Using this you configure what happens between two entities of a specific mode, their collision code affect their mode, consume an entity, change the mode of other entity types, update scores or lives, etc.\n\n- The main focus of this is you have entity A and entity B, some events like update score are entity antagonist in which case you can set it to event A or event B, other events such as consume should be placed under the entity you want that event to effect (so if you have consume and you want to consume entity A, place it under event A).
FIRST_GAME_TITLE=Creating Your First Game
FIRST_GAME_CONTENT=Basic steps to create a simple game:\n\n1. Create entity types (player, enemies, collectibles, obstacles)\n2. Configure their appearance and properties\n3. Set up collision rules between them\n4. Place entities on the canvas to design levels\n5. Configure win/lose conditions\n6. Save your game and test it in the Engine
TIPS_AND_TRICKS_TITLE=Tips and Tricks
TIPS_AND_TRICKS_CONTENT=Helpful tips for efficient game authoring:\n\n-Use meaningful names for entity types and levels\n-Start with a simple game to learn the basics\n-Test your game frequently during development\n-Create reusable entity types to save time\n-Use right-click context menus for quick actions\n-Save your work often!
CONCLUSION_TITLE=Ready to Create!
CONCLUSION_CONTENT=You now know the basics of the Game Authoring Environment!\n\nRemember that game development is an iterative process. Start simple, test often and gradually add complexity as you become more comfortable with the tools.\n\nHappy game creating!
